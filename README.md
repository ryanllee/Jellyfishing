# Jellyfishing Game
Very low level game using python and pygame

The purpose is to use the arrow keys on the keyboard and capture all the jelly fish before time runs out.
Player can choose from either playing the endless version or by levels.
As a level is completed more jellyfish appear on the screen and they move faster, more time is alloted as well.
If not all the jellyfish are caught in time the "Game over" screen displays.

Artwork not original.
